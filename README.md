# üëã Hi, I'm Sudharsan  

üéì Artificial Intelligence & Data Science Undergraduate | üíª AI/ML Developer | üî¨ Computer Vision & LLM Enthusiast  

I specialize in building **AI-powered applications** that bridge the gap between research and deployment.  
My work spans **computer vision, natural language processing, large language models, and applied machine learning**,  
with projects that demonstrate **end-to-end system design** ‚Äî from training deep learning models to deploying full-stack AI solutions.  

I‚Äôm a strong believer in **ethical AI** and the value of creating **resource-efficient, local-first solutions** such as offline LLMs and lightweight CV pipelines.  
Beyond academics, I‚Äôm constantly experimenting with **generative AI, similarity search, re-identification, and real-time video analytics**, always focusing on real-world utility.
